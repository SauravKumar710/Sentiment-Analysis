# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis of product based reviews using Machine Learning Approaches.

## Description
The objective of this project is to conduct sentiment analysis on online product reviews by utilizing different machine learning classifiers. The project focuses on analyzing sentiment at the document level, specifically for online product reviews obtained from the website amazon.com. The dataset used in the project includes approximately 35 million reviews from the Amazon reviews dataset, spanning a duration of 18 years up until March 2013. The reviews comprise product and user details, ratings, and plain text reviews.

To create the final dataset, 200,000 random samples were taken for each review score ranging from 1 to 5, resulting in a total of 1,000,000 samples. The project involves a comparative analysis of the performance of four machine learning classifiers: Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, and Random Forest. The best classifier was selected to standardize the model for classifying any future product reviews with favorable results. The selected model classifies user reviews based on their sentiment orientation as either positive or negative, using the chosen classifier to analyze the input text's sentiment categories.
